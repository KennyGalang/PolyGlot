# PolyGlot

PolyGlot is a multi-threaded Mobile Application developed in Android studio that allows users to translate any video's audio output into a different language in real time. This was created at YHacks at Yale University.


<h3>Tools Used</h3>
- Microsoft Video Indexer to get a transcript of the provided video and make use of the time stamps<br>
- Android Text to Speech API to convert the audio into any language specified by the user<br>
- Firebase to store the uploaded video files
<h3>Inspiration</h3>
Although we are now able to transcribe subtitles for any video in any language, we noticed that there is no technology that facilitates audio-to-audio translation in real time. Oftentimes, when watching a video – such as a foreign movie or TV show – in another language with subtitles, attention is diverted away from the picture onscreen and focused more on the text at the bottom, which can detract from the viewing experience altogether. This audio-to-audio translation therefore allows the viewer to fully immerse themselves in the video they are watching, and concurrently eliminates the need for film/TV companies to rerecord their productions in other languages.
